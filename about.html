          <h2>About Tendai</h2>
          <p>
            I am an aspiring game developer and student currently studying at
            SAE Institute Johannesburg and a very avid gamer. Games have always
            been apart of my life since childhood til now and what inspired me
            to make games was a quote that said "Be the change you want to see
            in the world", which inspired me to create the games that I and
            other people want to play as well. Some of my favourite games are
            the God of War series, Silent Hill, Uncharted and a new and current
            favourite is dispatch. The more boring parts are that I specialize
            in making 2D and 3D games, such as multiplayer platformers and 3D
            Co-op games that bring out the competitive nature in players.
            Additionally, I specialize in 2D environment and level design and
            sound design as I had a musical backgorund before branching into the
            dame development world.
